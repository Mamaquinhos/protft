# TFTourney UI

The TFTourney UI runs on top of React and it's connected to the backend graphQL API running on `localhost:3001`, so be sure to run the backend app together with it.

## Running the app

```bash
$ yarn start
```

This command should run the app at `localhost:3000`

## Test

```bash
$ yarn test
```

## Storybook

Run storybook with:

```bash
$ yarn storybook
```

But be aware, there are still problems with storybook + yarn pnp, so this is not working properly right now.
